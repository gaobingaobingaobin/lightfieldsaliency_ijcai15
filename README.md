# lightfieldsaliency_ijcai15

The code is used in our IJCAI15 paper.
Any 2D images generated from light-field data could be used to compute saliency maps, such as all-focus image, depth map, and focusness maps.

We also provided pre-computed saliency maps on the LFSD dataset for comparisons.

We also thank Zhu et al. to provide code for saliency optimization.
